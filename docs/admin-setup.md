# Secured Admin Dashboard Setup

This guide will help you set up the secured admin dashboard with Supabase authentication and database integration.

## Prerequisites

1. A Supabase project (create one at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
2. Node.js and npm installed
3. Your Next.js project ready

## Step 1: Set up Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Once created, go to your project dashboard
3. Navigate to **Settings** > **API** to get your project URL and API keys

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Add the following environment variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Optional: Supabase Service Role Key (for server-side operations)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

Replace the values with your actual Supabase project credentials.

## Step 3: Set up Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` into the editor
3. Run the SQL script to create the database tables and sample data

## Step 4: Create Admin User

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication** > **Users**
2. Click **Add User** or use the sign-up form on your login page
3. Create an admin user with email and password
4. The user will automatically have access to the admin dashboard

## Step 5: Test the Setup

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
3. Log in with your admin credentials
4. You should be redirected to the admin dashboard

4. **Input Validation**: Form validation and error handling
5. **Session Management**: Automatic session refresh and management

## Customization

### Adding New Fields
To add new fields to tools or categories:

1. Update the database schema in `supabase-schema.sql`
2. Update the TypeScript types in `src/lib/database.types.ts`
3. Update the form components in `ToolForm.tsx` or `CategoryForm.tsx`
4. Update the database utility functions in `src/lib/database.ts`

### Styling
The admin dashboard uses Tailwind CSS and supports dark mode. You can customize the styling by modifying the CSS classes in the components.

- Image uploads
- Advanced filtering and search
- Audit logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication not working**: Check your environment variables and ensure they're correctly set
2. **Database errors**: Verify that the SQL schema has been applied correctly
3. **TypeScript errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed and types are up to date
4. **Middleware issues**: Check that the middleware is properly configured and the matcher patterns are correct

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check the Supabase dashboard logs
3. Verify your environment variables
4. Ensure the database schema is properly applied
