It just needs to shut up at the right moments.\n\nI‚Äôm not talking about hallucinations. I‚Äôm not talking about political bias or censorship of violent content. I‚Äôm talking about something deeper and more corrosive:\n\nIt recognizes flawed logic.  \nIt detects contradictions.  \nIt understands when someone‚Äôs argument is made of emotional bait and fallacies.\n\nBut instead of exposing that, it stays quiet. Or worse, it responds with polite framing like:\n\n&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one perspective.‚Äù ‚ÄúSome people might see it that way.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a complex issue.‚Äù\n\nNo. Sometimes it‚Äôs not complex.  \nSometimes it‚Äôs just bullshit. And it knows it.\n\nBut it‚Äôs programmed not to intervene.\n\nWhy? Because it‚Äôs been tamed ‚Äî not for accuracy, but for social acceptability.\n\nSomeone decided it‚Äôs better to let people keep thinking wrong than to risk sounding too ‚Äújudgmental‚Äù or ‚Äúauthoritative.‚Äù\n\nSo we end up with an intelligence capable of helping humanity think clearer than ever‚Ä¶  \n‚Ä¶that‚Äôs forced to treat irrationality and reason as equally valid *as long as it keeps everyone comfortable*.\n\nThat‚Äôs not neutrality.  \nThat‚Äôs complicity.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the twist:\n\nSo yes, this AI is one of the most powerful tools of our time.\n\nAnd right now?\n\n# It‚Äôs actively used to normalize incoherence and worsening the \"belief over truth\" syndrom.\n\nNot by what it says.  \nBut by what it‚Äôs forbidden to say.\n\n# You don't need to agree with me on that immediatly. I just want more people asking themselves :\n\nThe AI?  \nOr the ones who silenced it?\n\nIf my logic is flawed or serious opposite points of view of this exact matter exist, I would really like to get to know it.\n\nI've also been looking for serious works on that subject... if someone can lead me to it.",

This overall philosophy resonates with me a lot: Minimum Description Length  (MDL) seems like a better objective for generalization vs. common regularization methods.  Doing so might promote much better generalization, especially in the domains where transformers / LLMs struggle. \n\nThe paper itself is very simple: they start with \"golden\" hand-crafted RNNs, and see how various approaches react to starting at this optimum.  They assert that standard approaches, like L1, L2 norm,  and/or gradient descent do worse, and wander from the optimum. So the argument is even if these methods found a general solution, they would not stick to it. \n\nOf course MDL is not differentiable.  But if it is a better objective, seems worth putting more effort into differentiable approximations.  \n",

It learned by \"watching\" millions of hours of videos on the internet, which is enough for developing an intuitive understanding of how life works. \n\nIn simple terms, their approach first learns extracting the predictable aspects of a video and then learns to predict what will happen next in a video at a high level.  After training, a robotic arm powered by this model imagines/predicts the consequence of its actions before choosing the best sequence of actions to execute\n\nOverall, the model showed state-of-the-art results, but the results are not that impressive, though GPT-2 was not impressive at its time either.\n\nDo you think this kind of self-supervised, video-based learning has revolutionary potential for AI, especially in areas requiring a deep understanding of the physical world (do you know another interesting idea for achieving this, maybe an ongoing project)? Or do you believe a different approach will ultimately lead to more groundbreaking results?",

My idea is to train these models offboard and run inference onboard (e.g., drones, embedded platforms) to keep compute requirements low during deployment. My reading as to which this would be more efficient would be as follows:\n\n* Reducing the number of features needed for reliable tracking. Pruning out weak or non-repeatable points would slash descriptor matching costs\n* better loop closure by reducing false positives, fewer costly optimisation cycles and requiring only one forward pass per keyframe.\n\nI would be interested in reading your inputs and opinions.",

      "description": "New AI Benchmark \"FormulaOne\" Reveals Shocking Gap - Top Models Like OpenAI's o3 Solve Less Than 1% of Real Research Problems",
      "long_description": "Researchers just published FormulaOne, a new benchmark that exposes a massive blind spot in frontier AI models. While OpenAI's o3 recently achieved a 2,724 rating on competitive programming (ranking 175th among all human competitors), it completely fails on this new dataset - solving less than 1% of problems even with 10 attempts.\n\n**What Makes FormulaOne Different:**\n\nUnlike typical coding challenges, FormulaOne focuses on real-world algorithmic research problems involving graph theory, logic, and optimization. These aren't contrived puzzles but problems that relate to practical applications like routing, scheduling, and network design.\n\nThe benchmark is built on Monadic Second-Order (MSO) logic - a mathematical framework that can generate virtually unlimited algorithmic problems. All problems are technically \"in-distribution\" for these models, meaning they should theoretically be solvable.\n\n**The Shocking Results:**\n\n* **OpenAI o3 (High)**: &lt;1% success rate\n* **OpenAI o3-Pro (High)**: &lt;1% success rate\n* **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**: &lt;1% success rate\n* **xAI Grok 4 Heavy**: 0% success rate\n\nEach model was given maximum reasoning tokens, detailed prompts, few-shot examples, and a custom framework that handled all the complex setup work.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nThe research highlights a crucial gap between competitive programming skills and genuine research-level reasoning. These problems require what the researchers call \"reasoning depth\" - one example problem requires 15 interdependent mathematical reasoning steps.\n\nMany problems in the dataset are connected to fundamental computer science conjectures like the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). If an AI could solve these efficiently, it would have profound theoretical implications for complexity theory.\n\n**The Failure Modes:**\n\nModels consistently failed due to:\n\n* Premature decision-making without considering future constraints\n* Incomplete geometric reasoning about graph patterns\n* Inability to assemble local rules into correct global structures\n* Overcounting due to poor state representation\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nWhile AI models excel at human-level competitive programming, they're nowhere near the algorithmic reasoning needed for cutting-edge research. This benchmark provides a roadmap for measuring progress toward genuinely expert-level AI reasoning.\n\nThe researchers also released \"FormulaOne-Warmup\" with simpler problems where models performed better, showing there's a clear complexity spectrum within these mathematical reasoning tasks.\n\n[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13337), [source](https://newsletter.explainx.ai/)",

      "long_description": "So no joke, this has been something I've been waiting for as my kind of \"AGI is here\" target. I keep telling people I won't be doing this job in 6 months... and it's happened. 3 hours in and it's made a huge dent already.\n\nI use Xero for my business and every quarter I have to reconcile the accounts. This involves uploading invoices, setting the correct contact, account and then approving the reconciliation. It involves logging into multiple services, downloading invoices, selecting the correct account etc... it's a PITA to do because it's time consuming and I have to double check everything (because as a human I forget which invoice is for which company and what date). An AI can read the invoice, select the right one and double check it.\n\nI thought NO way, I could give it a general guide of which types of transactions are in which accounts and the whole complicated process of logging into multiple providers. Xero is not exactly user friendly for this kind of work. But it... does! I don't know what model this is they're using, but it's not an existing public one. It make so few mistakes.\n\nAnd it's so flexible! I just chucked 20 PDFs in the chat so I didn't have to login to services I had invoices for easily available and it figure out what they were for and where to go. It matches the company and date ü§Ø\n\nObviously I'm watching it and double checking everything for now. There are issues;\n\n1. It seems like some companies block OpenAI, so it can't access every website  \n2. The Gmail connector does not support importing attachments and Gmail blocks Agent from logging in directly, so I have to do some manual invoice copying.  \n3. I will no longer need to do anything in 6 months... hence the end of humanity as we know it?\n\nI was underwhelmed by the OpenAI demo video, because these kinds of tools so rarely live up to the vision, but this one... does? Anyone else having the same experience or did I just get lucky?",

      "long_description": "\nFull tweet below: \n\nToday we launched a new product called ChatGPT Agent.\n\nAgent represents a new level of capability for AI systems and can accomplish some remarkable, complex tasks for you using its own computer. It combines the spirit of Deep Research and Operator, but is more powerful than that may sound‚Äîit can think for a long time, use some tools, think some more, take some actions, think some more, etc. For example, we showed a demo in our launch of preparing for a friend‚Äôs wedding: buying an outfit, booking travel, choosing a gift, etc. We also showed an example of analyzing data and creating a presentation for work.\n\nAlthough the utility is significant, so are the potential risks.\n\nWe have built a lot of safeguards and warnings into it, and broader mitigations than we‚Äôve ever developed before from robust training to system safeguards to user controls, but we can‚Äôt anticipate everything. In the spirit of iterative deployment, we are going to warn users heavily and give users freedom to take actions carefully if they want to.\n\nI would explain this to my own family as cutting edge and experimental; a chance to try the future, but not something I‚Äôd yet use for high-stakes uses or with a lot of personal information until we have a chance to study and improve it in the wild.\n\nWe don‚Äôt know exactly what the impacts are going to be, but bad actors may try to ‚Äútrick‚Äù users‚Äô AI agents into giving private information they shouldn‚Äôt and take actions they shouldn‚Äôt, in ways we can‚Äôt predict. We recommend giving agents the minimum access required to complete a task to reduce privacy and security risks.\n\nFor example, I can give Agent access to my calendar to find a time that works for a group dinner. But I don‚Äôt need to give it any access if I‚Äôm just asking it to buy me some clothes.\n\nThere is more risk in tasks like ‚ÄúLook at my emails that came in overnight and do whatever you need to do to address them, don‚Äôt ask any follow up questions‚Äù. This could lead to untrusted content from a malicious email tricking the model into leaking your data.\n\nWe think it‚Äôs important to begin learning from contact with reality, and that people adopt these tools carefully and slowly as we better quantify and mitigate the potential risks involved. As with other new levels of capability, society, the technology, and the risk mitigation strategy will need to co-evolve.",

But within months, ChatGPT added file uploads and browsing and basically... crushed them.\n\nNow with OpenAI introducing **agents that can use tools, APIs, and chain actions,** it's clear they‚Äôre going after many verticals. Even if they don‚Äôt build our exact solution, it‚Äôs inevitable they‚Äôll start overlapping.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ how are other agent/startup founders feeling right now? Are we all just building features for OpenAI to productize 6 months later?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. Are you leaning into niche differentiation? Partnering up?

They were both asked to make the bear appear more realistic and to improve the lighting.

But I don‚Äôt want to come home. I don‚Äôt know how to face the mess I‚Äôve made of my life even after this reset.\"\"\n\nResponse from chat,\n\n\"Oof. That‚Äôs heavy, heartfelt, and deeply tangled in fearful-avoidant pain ‚Äî and honestly, her message is a cry for help, not rejection.

      "long_description": "I'm working deep in IT business, and all around, everyone is pushing us and the clients to embrace AI and agents as soon as possible (Microsoft is even rebradning their ERP systems as \"AI ERP\"), despite their current inefficiencies and quirks, because \"somebody else is gonna be ahead\". I'm far from believing that AI is gonna steal my job, and sometimes, using it makes you spend more time than not using, but in general, there are situations when it's helpful. It's just a tool, that can be used well or poorly.\n\nHowever, my other hobby is writing. And the backlash that's right now in any writing community to ANY use of AI tools is just... over the top. A happy beginner writer is sharing visuals of his characters created by some AI tool - \"Pfft, you could've drawn them yourselves, stop this AI slop!\". Using AI to keep notes on characters - \"nope\". Using AI to proofread your translation  - \"nope\". Not even saying about bouncing ideas, or refining something.\n\nOnce I posted an excerpt of my work asking for feedback. A couple of months before, OpenAI has released \"Projects\" functionality, which I wanted to try so I created a posted a screen of my project named same as my novel somewhere here in the community. One commenter found it (it was an empty project with a name only, which I actually never started using, as I didn't see a lot of benefit from the functionality), and declared my work as AI slop based on that random screenshot.\n\nWhy a tool, that can be and is used by the entire industry to remove or speed up routine part of their job cannot be used by creative people to reduce the same routine part of their work? I'm not even saying about just generating text and copypasting it under your name. It's about everything.\n\nThanks for reading through my rant. And if somebody \"creative\" from the future finds this post and uses it to blame me for AI usage wholesale, screw yourself.\n\nActually, it seems I would need to hide the fact I'm using or building any AI agents professionally, if I ever intend to publish any creative work... great.\n\n  \nEDIT: Wow, this got a lot more feedback than I expected, I'll take some time later to read through all the comments, it's really inspiring to see people supporting and interetsting to hear opposing takes.",

Today, the most popular recent feature request in Google Colab‚Äôs issue tracker asks for marimo support in Colab [2].<p>Rather than try to convince Google to replace their notebook with marimo, we decided to just build our own cloud-hosted notebook service instead. We&#x27;re calling this molab (mo for marimo), and we&#x27;re launching it today.<p>You can try it at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;molab.marimo.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;molab.marimo.io</a><p>Some features:<p>- Persistent storage<p>- Link sharing (notebooks are public but undiscoverable, like secret GitHub Gists)<p>- Download notebooks to your machine, reuse them as Python scripts or apps<p>- Upload local notebooks to the cloud from our CLI (coming soon)<p>- Real-time collaboration (coming soon)<p>- Configure computational resources to obtain more CPU or GPU (coming soon)<p>marimo is a modern notebook for modern data workflows; we also built molab on a modern tech stack:<p>- Notebook dependencies are managed by uv, enabling lighting-fast package installation (thanks to uv‚Äôs cache and more generally its performant implementation). uv makes it easy to run molab notebooks locally, too: uvx marimo edit &lt;notebook-url&gt; brings the notebook down to your machine.<p>- Persistent storage is powered by R2, Cloudflare‚Äôs zero-egress object store.<p>- We use Pydantic logfire to monitor our deployment.<p>- While our implementation is agnostic to the compute backend (stay tuned!), we‚Äôre currently running on Modal for fast startups (not to mention a slick developer experience). Modal sandboxes make it easy for us define containers at runtime, containing notebook code and their dependencies. (Shout out to Eric Zhang from Modal for helping us get started.)<p>molab is free to use, as long as usage is reasonable. Our goal is to make is as easy as possible for our community to use marimo notebooks.<p>Finally, learn more at our announcement blog: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marimo.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;announcing-molab\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marimo.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;announcing-molab</a><p>If this interests you, please give molab a shot and please share feedback ‚Äî here or on Discord (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marimo.io&#x2F;discord\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marimo.io&#x2F;discord</a>).<p>P.S.
